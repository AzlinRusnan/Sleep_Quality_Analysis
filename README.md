## Problem Statement
The purpose of this analysis is to investigate the relationships between "Sleep Duration" and various lifestyle, health, and demographic factors. The goal is to understand how these factors collectively influence sleep duration and to build a predictive model using multiple linear regression. By selecting the best set of predictors, we aim to develop an accurate model that can provide insights into sleep duration patterns.
